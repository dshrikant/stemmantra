# Welcome to STEM Mantra
Preparing Girls for BETTER TOMMORROW

## Our mission

Empower today's girls to become tomorrow’s leaders through technology and ignite their passion for STEM.

## Our Story

TEM Mantra found that young women far less likely to view STEM as a possible career path because of lack of interesting and inspiring technology knowledge and easy access to mentors & role models. We created STEM mantra to ignite power in girls. Our objective is to learn, inspire and innovate to make meaningful social impact. We provide online and on-site technology workshops for girls, hosts programs and initiatives to promote, inspire and build confidence in girls by connecting them with successful female role models from the technology industry to create a positive impact.
